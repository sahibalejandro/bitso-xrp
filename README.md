## Frontend development
Frontend is made with React using `create-react-app` tool.  
Just start the development server as usual, it runs on `localhost:3000`.

Use `"proxy": "localhost:3001"` in order to make api calls to the backend.

```bash
cd frontend
yarn start
```

## Backend development
The backend is a simple API mad with express.  
Just start the express server as usual, it runs on `localhost:3001`
